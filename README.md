# README #

A place to test 3d game ideas using OpenGL.  Currently, working on the Linux app, Windows needs to be updated to build.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Just hacking around.  Pulling pieces from other projects to do this.
* 0.1
*  Two main()s.  One was when I thought about doing a "Minecraft"-like thing.  Had a pulsing sphere in the sky made of blocks.  Second one is what I did today - create a simple grid and allow a player to run, crawl, walk, or fly around.  Hit detects on walls.  Added a monster cube.  Added a mouse click I was about to add attacking through.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Linux - standard dev install, with glew.
* Windows MSVC 2015 Community Edition project.
* Configuration - none.
* Dependencies - OpenGL.
* Deployment instructions - build and run.
